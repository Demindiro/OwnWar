# Beginner's tutorial

This is a brief tutorial for players who are new to this game. It is still
very much a work-in-progress and will at some point be replaced with an
in-game guide.


## Creating a basic vehicle.

A valid vehicle has a few basic requirements:

* There must be **exactly** one mainframe. You can find the mainframe block in
  the `Other` tab in the inventory (you can open it with) E.

* All blocks must be connected. All bodies that do not have a mainframe must
  have **exactly** one connection to a parent body.


### Creating turrets.

1) Place a turret block on a body (e.g. the main body).

2) Create a new layer, which is done with the `+` in the bottom-left window.

3) Make sure you switched to the new layer. The previous body should now be
   transparent.

4) Place blocks on top of the turret block.

5) Repeat this process for sub-turrets.
