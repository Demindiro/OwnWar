# Contributing

Bug reports, ideas, code, assets ... are always very welcome! There are a few
guidelines:

* Ideas and/or suggestions should be posted in **Discussions**

* Bug reports should be posted in **Issues**. If you discover a security
  vulnerability, please email one of the maintainers directly.

* Generally, an issue or discussion should be created before a PR is made.
  This is to avoid potentially wasting effort if a PR would be rejected.
