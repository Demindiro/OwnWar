# 0.18 Roadmap

## Optimization
- Dramatically decrease server and client CPU usage
  - Using kinematic bodies
  - Allows increasing tickrate -> less tunnneling
  - Will make anti-cheat harder
    - Concensus algorithm
  - Damage will remain server-side
- Rework savefile format (again)
  - Manually apply compression so we can _easily_ stream it over the net
  - Store big array instead of storing block locations
    - Easier to compress + less data on average

## UI/UX
- Make a proper lobby with search functionality and a proper info board
  - Move the direct connect and hosting menus to separate tabs

## Weapons
- Add "plasma" (explosive) cannon
- Add railgun
  - Make railgun the gun with deep pen, make laser a "heatgun" instead
    - Heat = transfers to whatever nearby blocks

## Movement
- Add thrusters
- Add wings
  - TODO: should it "magically" balance constructs somewhat? And how?
- Add rotors

## Decoration
- Add glowing blocks

## Damage system
- Fix physics body not updating on damage
- Fix mass not updating on damage
- Fix blocks not properly disconnecting
- Disallow "cyclic" turrets (i.e. turrets with more than one connected). This is
  necessary anyways due to physics spazzing out.
